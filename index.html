        <h2>Project Description</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          This project aims to develop a secure and reliable food delivery application specifically designed for individuals who live or work on military bases. Traditional food delivery platforms such as DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Grubhub do not adequately address the unique access restrictions associated with military installations. As a result, drivers without proper base clearance are often unable to complete deliveries, creating inconvenience for residents and operational inefficiencies for vendors.<br>Our application provides a streamlined solution by ensuring that all participating drivers are properly vetted and authorized to access military bases before they are permitted to accept delivery requests. The platform integrates a verification system that confirms driver credentials, base access eligibility, and compliance with installation-specific requirements.
